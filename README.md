#Setting up Unity with Android Cardboard 
1. Follow the instruction here: https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/get-started-android
2.  If you get an error upon starting the Android Studio along the lines of "Environment variable does not point to a valid JVM installation", go to `Computer > System Properties > Advanced System Settings > Advanced > Environment Variables > System Variables` and add JDK_HOME (instead of JAVA_HOME) with the Java version you installed.
3. Make sure the Android build support is installed in Unity if the `File > Build Options > Android` is grayed out.
