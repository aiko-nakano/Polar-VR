**Setting up Unity with Android Cardboard 
+Follow the instruction here: https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/get-started-android
+ If you get an error starting the Android Studio, modify the environment variable (`Computer > System Properties > Advanced System Settings > Advanced > Environment Variables > System Variables` with JDK_HOME (instead of JAVA_HOME) with the Java version you installed.
+ Also make sure the Android build support is installed in Unity if the `File > Build Options > Android` is grayed out.
